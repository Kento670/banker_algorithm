**By: Kent Ogasawara**


## Description
This project implements the Banker’s Algorithm for deadlock avoidance using C++. The algorithm ensures that the system remains in a safe state by simulating resource allocation and checking for potential deadlocks.The program determines if the system is in a safe state and outputs a safe sequence of process execution if one exists.

## Requirements
- C/C++ compiler on Linux/Unix environment.
- input.txt file

## Compilation

To compile the source files, run the following commands:

    g++ bankers_algorithm.cpp -o bankers_algorithm
    ./bankers_algorithm

## Example Output
Here’s an example output on Ubuntu in VirtualBox:
